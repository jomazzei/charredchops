<h1 align="center">Charred Chops</h1>

[View live deployment here!](https://jomazzei-charred-chops-161a869d9d8b.herokuapp.com/)

<p>This website project is for a hypothetical steakhouse, Charred Chops, with the main goal of offering a user friendly manner to book and manage a reservation with the restaurant.</p>
<p>In future the features of the application will scale beyond just user reservation, also offering the staff a way to manage the displayed menu and manage all customer bookings</p>

### Content and Code
- Design inspirationas from [Miller & Carter steakhouse](https://www.millerandcarter.co.uk/).
- Baseline HTML template for AllAuth taken from [Django blog walkthrough project](https://github.com/jomazzei/django-blog), originally created by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/?_gl=1*xh7bh0*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwkuqvBhAQEiwA65XxQA_KVRG0RaWOXmBe9aqfp9kJ_Vw14KkL0WQhpPMGA4STT5MNmkBC2hoC-aUQAvD_BwE).
- Baseline code for similar functions, such as List view and Form submission view adapted from [Django blog walkthrough project](https://github.com/jomazzei/django-blog), originally created by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/?_gl=1*xh7bh0*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwkuqvBhAQEiwA65XxQA_KVRG0RaWOXmBe9aqfp9kJ_Vw14KkL0WQhpPMGA4STT5MNmkBC2hoC-aUQAvD_BwE).
- ReadMe structure templated from the hackathon project [Campus Connect](https://github.com/jomazzei/campus-connect), from which the ReadMe was originally based off of hackathon project [Belgian Bakes](https://github.com/Tariq-845/belgian-bakes).
- Referred to various sources (not all inclusive) for fixes and implementations for features I wasn't knowledgeable on:
  - Django docs
  - Bootstrap docs
  - Stackoverflow
  - ChatGPT
  - YouTube
  - W3 Schools
  - Geeks for Geeks

<br>

#### Note on the use of ChatGPT for coding related queries:
I ensured that I used ChatGPT only as an assisting tool throughout this project.
Most use-cases were not finding the right answers on stackoverflow to aid in writing out my functions or needing a more specific question answered.
These answers were often items in the Django docs or other tools and packages that I didn't know existed - such as built-in parameters like "context_object_name" and "validators", or "datetime" and "string" modules.

In more specific code block cases, my questions centered around debugging and making sure I was on the right track for the sake of time.
One such instance is writing a for loop for every form error from the view rather than the template, and displaying them in a single toast message. I couldn't get it to work within a single toast message and went back to iterating from the template
