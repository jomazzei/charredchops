[View live deployment here!](https://jomazzei-charred-chops-161a869d9d8b.herokuapp.com/)

<p>This website project is for a hypothetical steakhouse, Charred Chops, with the main goal of offering a user friendly manner to book and manage a reservation with the restaurant.</p>
<p>In future the features of the application will scale beyond just user reservation, also offering the staff a way to manage the displayed menu and manage all customer bookings</p>

## Agile and Tech Stack Overview
[back to content table](#table-of-contents)

<br>

#### Ideation and Agile
<p>
 During the ideation process for choosing a project I referred to the briefs on the CI LMS. I ended up choosing the restaurant booking system as the outline for my project.
 I did some quick brainstorming for names and wrote out baseline user stories, whether those be current or future iterations, that informed the core features of the website.<br>
</p>
<p>
 Throughout development I would add more user stories to my project board that would expand the website's functionality and enrich it's value, while ensuring I maintained a focussed scope and goal for this deadline<br>
 I split certain features into easier to track issues or task checklists depending on whether they were explicitly part of a user story or not.<br>
 Certain design aspects would fit into that category, such as error pages. They could have been rephrased and reworked into more stories but I felt it would take away from the main focus
 of agile, which is to inform scope and promote efficiency throughout an iteration through breaking down tasks.
</p>

<br>

#### Tech Stack
<p>
 The following high level technologies and frameworks were used to deliver the project in it's current state:
</p>

- VS Code
- Lucidchart
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript
- Python 3.12
- Django 4.2

<p>
 For a detailed list of package usage and requirements, please see the requirements.txt.

## Wireframes and Database schema

<br>

### Home Page

<br>

### Booking Page

<br>

### Database Diagram
![database](/DocAssets/lucidchart-schema.png)

<p>
 I drew out the model quite broadly initially, more fitting to a larger scope and longer iteration.<br>
 During the prioritization I narrowed down the model quite a bit to focus more on the key feature of booking a reservation

## User Stories and Features

### Content and Code
- Design inspirationas from [Miller & Carter steakhouse](https://www.millerandcarter.co.uk/).
- Baseline HTML template for AllAuth taken from [Django blog walkthrough project](https://github.com/jomazzei/django-blog), originally created by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/?_gl=1*xh7bh0*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwkuqvBhAQEiwA65XxQA_KVRG0RaWOXmBe9aqfp9kJ_Vw14KkL0WQhpPMGA4STT5MNmkBC2hoC-aUQAvD_BwE).
- Baseline code for similar functions, such as List view and Form submission view adapted from [Django blog walkthrough project](https://github.com/jomazzei/django-blog), originally created by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/?_gl=1*xh7bh0*_up*MQ..&gclid=CjwKCAjwkuqvBhAQEiwA65XxQA_KVRG0RaWOXmBe9aqfp9kJ_Vw14KkL0WQhpPMGA4STT5MNmkBC2hoC-aUQAvD_BwE).
- ReadMe structure templated from the hackathon project [Campus Connect](https://github.com/jomazzei/campus-connect), from which the ReadMe was originally based off of hackathon project [Belgian Bakes](https://github.com/Tariq-845/belgian-bakes).
- Referred to various sources (not all inclusive) for fixes and implementations for features I wasn't knowledgeable on:
  - Django docs
  - Bootstrap docs
  - Stackoverflow
  - ChatGPT
  - YouTube
  - W3 Schools
  - Geeks for Geeks

<br>

#### Note on the use of ChatGPT for coding related queries:
I ensured that I used ChatGPT only as an assisting tool throughout this project.
Most use-cases were not finding the right answers on stackoverflow to aid in writing out my functions or needing a more specific question answered.
These answers were often items in the Django docs or other tools and packages that I didn't know existed - such as built-in parameters like "context_object_name" and "validators", or "datetime" and "string" modules.

In more specific code block cases, my questions centered around debugging and making sure I was on the right track for the sake of time.
One such instance is writing a for loop for every form error from the view rather than the template, and displaying them in a single toast message. I couldn't get it to work within a single toast message and went back to iterating from the template
